__*CELAUT is a set of simple rules for software design and distribution. It is based on two main elements: nodes and services.*__

This architecture allows services to focus on their functionality, without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. Nodes, for their part, can efficiently manage the execution of instances, without worrying about their usefulness.

It is based on the principles:
1. Descentralization
2. Simplicity
3. Determinism
